Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
    - Standups, end-of-day-reviews, and check-ins throughout the day. Listening to team members regarding their interest in coding certain features. Leveraging skill sets, but also allowing growth into areas where a team member might not be the strongest.
