# Archi-Trek

- Vacation planning app
  - User enters location
  - App gives back weather for the week with icons for different types of weather (Carousel Cards)
  - Also gives suggestions for what to pack
      - (Based on temperature, number of days the trip is, whether or not there will be swimming involved, etc)
  - Use OAuth to login so that users can enter their address (and have that info stored securely)
    - see how far they are from the location they’re planning 
    - so they can know what means of transportation are available for them to use
